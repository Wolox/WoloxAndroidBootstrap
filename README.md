# Wolox Android Bootstrap

This is the base template project that we use at [Wolox](https://www.wolox.com.ar/) for new Android applications.

This project integrates useful libraries and [WOLMO](https://github.com/Wolox/wolmo-core-android), our framework for developing
Android apps.


## Features

These features can be found in Wolox Android Boostrap:

* Fully integrated with [WOLMO](https://github.com/Wolox/wolmo-core-android)
and [WOLMO NETWORKING](https://github.com/Wolox/wolmo-networking-android)
* Usage example of the MVP architecture.
* Usage example of Dagger 2 with WOLMO and WOLMO NETWORKING modules.
* Has [WARP](https://github.com/Wolox/warp) for quick assets creation and optimization.
* Includes [Chuck](https://github.com/jgilfelt/chuck) for easy HTTP requests logging.
* Includes [Leak Canary](https://github.com/square/leakcanary) for memory leak detection.
* Includes some additional dependencies for testing.
* Base build variants set up for production and development.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Change the **applicationId** in the *app/build.gradle* file
3. Change the ***BootstrapApplication*** class name to the name of your application
4. Setup the API endpoints (if necessary) in the *Configuration*/*BaseConfiguration* classes
5. Change the launcher icons under *main*/*stage* directories
6. Setup the production keystore credentials: run `scripts/keystore.sh` from the project root directory or create *app/keystore.gradle* file manually:
```gradle

ext.key_alias='...'

ext.store_password='...'
```
